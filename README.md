# thinklaunch-example
This is an example repository for the ThinkLaunch Code Academy

I'm taking this class because I want to launch my cool idea, and I think this is a greta way to learn how to do that. 

## Chosen Idea:
**To address `add problem`, knowing that `add constraints` and `add context`, I'm going to `add solution`, and `add impact` for `add audiences` everywhere!!**
